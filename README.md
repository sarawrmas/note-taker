## Deployed
Click [here](https://frozen-harbor-03363.herokuapp.com/) to access the application.

## Description
As a small business owner, you want to be able to write and save notes so that you can organize your thoughts and keep track of tasks you need to complete. This is where the note taker comes in.

With all of your notes in one place, it is easy to navigate through your to-dos, adding and deleting as needed, all in one webpage.

## Languages
This application was built using:
* JavaScript
* HTML
* CSS
* Node/NPM
* Express
* Heroku

## Usage
This is a simple website that allows you to do exactly as its title proclaims: take notes.

Each note has a title and subtext. By clicking the plus sign on the top right of the screen, you can add a note.

Once you're done filling in the two fields, a save button will appear next to the add button.

Upon saving, your note will be added and the title will be displayed on the left side of the screen along with your other notes.

Upon clicking on a saved note's title, its content will repopulate the right side of the screen where you can once again view its full content.

Each note in the list also has a delete button that, when clicked, will permanently remove that note.
